## My CI/CD Experience

I have been exposed to CI/CD pipelines but never interacted with them myself. For example, last summer I interned at Appian, a process automation company, and was introduced to the process of using Jenkins to analyze tests from my commits as well as the Quality Engineer on our team reviewing overall pipeline performance before my manager is able to approve my merge request. 

I think this may be a similar experience for me moving forward, as bigger companies don't usually have software engineers running the code and pipelines. 

Today was my first time ever creating my own GitHub Action workflow.
